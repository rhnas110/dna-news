## Introduction

**DNA News** is a web application that provides news from around the world. It fetches news data from the **[NewsAPI]** service. Users can browse through a list of news articles, search for specific articles, and keep track of articles they have read or clicked on. The website is built using [**Vite + React.js**][vite] and leverages local storage for storing the user's reading history.
